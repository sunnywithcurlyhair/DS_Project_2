    "Before discussing the relevant variables we found that may contribute to box office success it is important to understand the metric that we are using to quantify box office success. At first glance it may have been easy to just look at domestic gross totals, foreign gross totals and worldwide grossing totals but this does not account for the money spent getting the movie to the box office. For example a movie that grosses a hundred million dollars worldwide but had a production budget of ninty million has a much lower return on investment then a movie that grosses fifty million dollars but only cost ten million to make. Because of this we decided to create three metrics that we defined as domestic success, foreign success and worldwide success by taking the gross of each market (domestic, foreign and worldwide) and dividing it by the production budget. In doing so we created a standardized metric comparable across all movies no matter the budget. If this new metric was greater then 1 it meant that the movies made more money then they spent, i.e the larger the number the more profitable compared to the budget the movie was."

    "One of the first variables we chose to examine was the budget of a given movie. It felt clear to us that not all movies are made equal. A hundred million dollar movie and the variables influencing it's success feels much different then a fifty thousand dollar movie. After a little bit of outside research on industry standards we decided to split movies into three categories: low budget movies, mid budget movies and high budget movies. We defined low budget movies as movies with a production budget less then five million dollars. Mid budget movies are defined as movies with a budget between five and fifty million dollars and high budget movies with budgets greater then fifty million dollars."

Is there a sweet spot for profitable movies? Are people more likely to spend the money to watch to movie if it's short and sweet? Or are they more likely to gravitate towards the longer movie because they want the most bang for their buck? In an attempt to answer these questions we ran analysis on the runtime of movies compared to the ROI to see if we could gain any insight."

Although they all seem to be centralized around a similar point the analysis of the mean, standard deviation and standard error as well as the 95% confidence interval reconfirm what is visually aparent. The cheaper the movie the shorter the money making movies tend to be with much less leniance for different run times while as the movies get larger in scale there is more wiggle room for the runtime of a successful movie and movies tend to be longer."
